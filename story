Samosa goes to the gym to become muscular like Shakti Samosa.
 Jalebi writes a story about Samosa, and Vada and Dhokla add on to it.
  Samosa is surprised to learn that his friends are playing in the same game of cricket as he is.
   The gang goes on an undersea adventure.

   Samosa is woken up by his alarm clock and gets ready for the day.
    He then goes to his room to admire the wrestler Sumo Momo, who he has various posters of on his wall.
     He then watches a commercial online for his next wrestling match, which is taking place in Chatpata Nagar.
      An excited Samosa is greeted by Vada, who is talking to him from the 
      window (he is bouncing off of Dhokla to make it that high up);
  both are accompanied by Jalebi. The three remind him that they are to go to the match later.
While on their way there, Vada mentions Sumo Momo is so strong that nobody has defeated him.
 Samosa lies that he once defeated two Sumo Momos at once while playing with friends in Schezuan Town, 
 with a fantasy sequence indicating he also defeated several more afterwards. 

 All of his friends except Vada see through the lie, and Jalebi calls out Samosa for being a bluff master.
  The group make it to the stadium, where a challenger is blown outside and lands on the sidewalk next to Samosa, hurt.
   Samosa cheers for Sumo Momo and enters the stadium after Dhokla and Jalebi, completely disregarding the hurt challenger.

The announcer says that Samosa is the challenger who is going to fight Sumo Momo,
 much to the surprise of Samosa since he is very weak compared to him.
